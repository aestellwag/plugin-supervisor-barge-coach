# Twilio Flex Plugin - Supervisor Barge-In and Coach

Twilio Flex Plugins allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of [Twilio Flex](https://www.twilio.com/flex). If you want to learn more about the capabilities and how to use the API, check out our [Flex documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex).

This plugin adds a barge-in and coach button to the Monitor call canvas.  You can get to this via the Team View, click on the agent you wish to monitor and the buttons will be available once you begin to monitor the live calls.  The left button is the Barge-In button which allows you to join the conference all with the agent(s) and customer(s).  Toggling this button will mute/unmute yourself.  The right button is the Coach button which allows you to talk to the agent you are monitoring.  The no other member of the call will be able to hear you except for the monitored agent.  Toggling this button enables Coach and the left button converts to a Mute/Un-Mute button for the coaching mode.

First select the call/worker you wish to monitor

As of the Version 2 Update to the plugin, there has been an addition of the Coach Status Panel to the Agent's UI.  This UI change can be enabled/disabled by the below button (as of Version 2.1 of this plugin)

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as well as [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) installed.

Navigate to the primary plugin folder and run NPM install for the plugin
```bash

Navigate to the serverless folder, create and modify the .env file

npm install
```

Install the twilio plugin-serverless
```bash
Run: 
twilio plugins:install @twilio-labs/plugin-serverless
```

Deploy the serverless functions into Twilio
*Do this if you haven't deployed the serverless functions already*
```bash
Run: 
twilio serverless:deploy
```
Copy the domain as you'll need this for the .env in the next step


From the root plugin directory rename the .env.example file to .env and change the below:
```bash
cd ..
cd plugin-supervisor-barge-coach

var REACT_APP_SERVICE_BASE_URL = 
Points to the Twilio Function Service URL (example: https://barge-coach-XXXX-dev.twil.io)

Can be found by by going to https://www.twilio.com/console/functions/overview/services then click on barge-coach (should look like barge-coach-XXXX-dev.twil.io)

var REACT_APP_TASK-CHANNEL_SID =

From the public folder, create the appConfig.js and change on variable within it

change serviceBaseUrl: "https://barge-coach-XXXX.twil.io"
```

## Development

In order to develop locally, you can use the Webpack Dev Server by running (from the root plugin directory):

```bash
Twilio flex:plugins:start
```

This will automatically start up the Webpack Dev Server and open the browser for you. Your app will run on `http://localhost:3000`. If you want to change that you can do this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

When you make changes to your code, the browser window will be automatically refreshed.

```
Run: 
twilio flex:plugins:deploy --major --changelog "Notes for this version" --description "Functionality of the plugin"
